There are three ways to run StreamOS.

First, burn ready ISO image to CD-disk and boot from it.

Second, you may use some virtual machine, like VirtualBox, qemu, bochs.
Build system supports qemu and bochs automatically, you have only to install
them. Run "./sgen qemu" or "./sgen bochs" and enjoy.

Not to build kernel and ISO-image separately and then to run it, just type
"./sgen sys" and ISO-image will be generated from current sources and run
automatically under qemu.

Type login "root" and password "toor" to log in as superuser or "post"/"tsop"
to login as an ordinary user.

Press CTRL+q and youâ€™ll get next virtual screen activated.

Type "logout" to log out, "reboot" to reboot the computer, "suspend" (currently
only APM>=1.1 is supported) to suspend it or "poweroff" to turn power off.
