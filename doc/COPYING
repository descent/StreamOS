	"The copy of the program" means the identical to original stand-alone
copy of the program.

	"To distribute" means to transmit the copy of the program, its source
code, documentation, the copy of the License and all rights simultaneously under
the terms and conditions of the License. This term also includes a desire to
transmit the copy of the program, its source code and documentation expressed by
giving a possibility to get the copy of the program, its source code and
documentation in a free, free-of-charge and public way (e.g., from a web-site).

	"To modify" means to change the program, the copy of the program, its
source code and/or documentation according to the terms and conditions of the
License.

	"To use" means a possibility to use the program, the copy of the

	"Free program" means a program that is transmitted to other users
without any restrictions according to the terms and conditions of the License.

	"Closed program" means a program that has no public, free and
free-of-charge access to its source or binary code or documentation.

	"Fee-paying program" means that a program, its source code or
documentation from people, who involved directly in program's developing, are
distributed for rent.

	"Source code" means the human-readable form of the program that fits the
best to modify the program.

	"Documentation" means electronic information about a program, that
explains the principles of a program, informs about ways of using a program or
gives any other information about a program. Documentation is considered to be a
part of the program.

	First mentioning about a program, that is distributed under terms and
conditions of the License, in each article looks like "the program, that is
distributed under terms and conditions of the License". Other mentions about a
program in the same article looks like "the program".

	Each licensee is addressed as "you".
